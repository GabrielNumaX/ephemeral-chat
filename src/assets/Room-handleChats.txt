REDUCER: {
//this will BE selected username to OPEN chat and messages onClick
    selectedContact: null, 
//this will be ARRAY that will HOLD ALL chats with USERS
    allChats: [],

//ex. 
allChats: [
	{
	  contact: 'user02', 
	  messages: [{ date: '', sender: '', message: ''}]
	},
	{
	  contact: 'privUser', 
	  messages: [{ date: '', sender: '', message: ''}]
	},
	{
	  contact: 'chrome', 
	  messages: [{ date: '', sender: '', message: ''}]
	},
	...
} 

to AVOID duplicating react and redux states:
-store selected CONTACT with whom is having CHAT on redux's selectedContact:
-with that selectedContact create an OBJ with message DATA to store in messages ARRAY  in selectedContacts OBJ in allChats ARRAY of OBJS

-from that render messages FILTERING from contact KEY
-to add Messages -> actions to find allChats OBJ from contact from selectedContact and UPDATE messages array which WILL BE RENDERED after that
FOR THIS I CAN destructure messages FROM REDUX 

UPON changing selectedContact EXTRACT messages ARRAY from allChats-> contact OBJ to then DESTRUCTURE and RENDER/ADD messages
